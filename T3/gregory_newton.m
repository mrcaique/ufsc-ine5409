    DIVIDED DIFFERENCES
    Given the respective tabulated values in the table T1:
    
    Table T1 = {
        i  =  [1  2  ... n]
        xi = [x1 x2 ... xn]
        yi = [y1 y2 ... yn] = f(xi)
    }

    The divided difference delta^(k)y, in foward ward, is defined as:

    delta^(1)yi = (y[i+1] - y[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])
        For the first order difference
    delta^(k)yi = (delta^(k-1)y[i+1] - delta^(k-1)y[i]) / (x[i-k] - x[i])
        For the k-th order difference

	NEWTON POLYNOMIAL
	The Newton polynomial is a linear combination between "Newton basis
	polynomials" and the dividide differences. The result is:

	N(x) = y1 + dy1*(x - x1) + d^(2)y1*(x - x1)*(x - x2) + ...
        + d^(n)y1*(x - x1)*...*(x - xn)

    Args:
        points : points between a interval [a, b] ("Line of the points in x")
        x : x points in the tabulated table T1 (with correspondents y)
        y : y points in the tabulated table T1 (with correspondents x)
        n : number of points ("number of the columns in the table T1")

    Return:
        yPn : Newton polynomial
